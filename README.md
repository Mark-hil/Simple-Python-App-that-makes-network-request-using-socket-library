# Basic-Python-System-Monitor
This project demonstrates a basic client-server architecture using Python's socket library. The server.py script acts as the server, listening for incoming connections, while the client.py script acts as the client, sending requests to the server and receiving responses.

# Features
Server:

Listens for client connections on a specified host and port.
Processes incoming requests and sends responses back to the client.
Client:

# Connects to the server.
Sends a message and receives the server's response.
Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
# Usage
1. Run the Server
Start the server by running server.py. By default, it listens on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and port 8080. You can modify these settings in the script.

python server.py

The server will display messages indicating it is running and listening for connections.

3. Run the Client
After starting the server, run client.py to connect to the server and send a message.

python client.py

By default, the client connects to 127.0.0.1 on port 8080. Modify these settings in the script if needed.
